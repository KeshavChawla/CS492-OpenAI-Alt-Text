## Survey and Anonymized Results
[![Screenshot of a survey of different alt-text provided by OpenAI's GPT 4 Vision Preview, ChatGPT 4, and existing alt-text](https://github.com/KeshavChawla/CS492-OpenAI-Alt-Text/assets/21203253/cb695f0a-4a1a-4aca-a48d-ed63b16d9ba8)](https://forms.gle/1poeXuf556G8oz6P6)

The survey our team conducted to assess whether responses generated by OpenAI's GPT4 Vision Preview and ChatGPT 4 were any bit comparable to existing alt-text can be found here [https://forms.gle/1poeXuf556G8oz6P6](https://forms.gle/1poeXuf556G8oz6P6)

Anonymized results of the survey can be found in this repo under the [survey folder](https://github.com/KeshavChawla/CS492-OpenAI-Alt-Text/blob/main/survey/CS_492_Alt_Text_Survey_Anonymized.xlsx).

## Govermental Website Analysis

Research-based on our small-scale, non-intrusive polling of websites to determine the lack of existing alt-text can be found in the [research](https://github.com/KeshavChawla/CS492-OpenAI-Alt-Text/tree/main/research) folder along with the [code](https://github.com/KeshavChawla/CS492-OpenAI-Alt-Text/blob/main/research/webscrape.py) and the [raw data results](https://github.com/KeshavChawla/CS492-OpenAI-Alt-Text/blob/main/research/output.csv).

The research revealed some interesting findings. We hand-sampled 30 images each that had an empty alt-text attribute and a non-empty alt-text attribute to check for compliance. This manual verification was needed as our web scraping tool cannot decide whether an empty alt-text image belongs to a decorative image or an image that provides the necessary context. Additionally, our web scraper can not determine the quality of an alt-text attribute, it can only determine if it's non-empty. 

1. Even though images followed our definition of compliance (non-empty alt-text attribute) according to the web scraper, it didn't guarantee that the quality of the alt-text provided enough details about the image. Below are some images that did not have useful alt-text. 
   The image below had an alt-text attribute of “Nicholas Forget tile”.

  This image below had an alt-text attribute of "tab-1".

   This image below had an alt-text attribute of "play-icon", suggesting it was something name for/by developers.

   These images were just a few we found that had non-empty alt-text attributes but didn't contribute any useful information.  

2. After going through 60 images, 30 of which had empty alt-text attributes, and 30 that had non-empty alt-text attributes, we noticed that $\frac{54}{60}$ or 90% of the images we looked at use alt-text attributes correctly. To determine the accuracy of our web scraper, we created a binomial confidence interval (with our calculations below). The $z$-score that we chose was %1.96% (that corresponds to the 95% confidence interval). With $\hat{p} = \frac{54}{60}$ and $n = 60$, we plugged it into the formula below to calculate our interval.

   We calculated the 95% binomial confidence interval for the accuracy of our web scraper to be [82.4%, 97.6%]

   Thus, we are 95% confident that, after accounting for the error of our web scraper, 79.1% to 93.6% of images on Canadian governmental websites follow WCAG 2.0 guidelines.
